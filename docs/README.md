# Gotham documentation

In order to understand how gotham modules work, you'll need to read [this](./CONCEPTS) to get a hold of the concepts first.

Then, you can look at the [communication protocol](./COMMUNICATION-PROTOCOL) in case you're planning to implement a supporting library to interface with gotham.

You can also look at [error codes](./ERROR-CODES) to understand what kinds of errors are thrown by gotham.
